    <h1>Eesha's Garden in Karachi</h1>
    <p>My grandmother who lives in Karachi is obsessed with her garden. She has been working on it for several years. This website displays some of my favorite pictures of her garden.
    </p>
    <p>I'd also eventaully like to create a website portfolio to showcase my writing work and professional profile to potential employers. Here is a <a href = "portfolio.html">link </a> to my portfolio website, which still happens to be a work in progress. </p>
    <h4>Garden in full bloom</h4>
    <p>The abundant white-purple flowers are called Bougainvillea. These flowers bloom from May all the way to December!</p>

    <h4>View from Living Room</h4>
    <p>The Garden is designed such that there is foliage all around the house. Greenery is visible from every room in the house. Here is the view from our living room. </p>

    <h4>View from the Study</h4>
    <p>Here is the view from the Study window. Pipes running along the top of the hut drip water into the fountain. Because the wind blows in from the East window, this creates a profound cooling effect in the room when the window is open.</p>
